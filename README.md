## Rapid Protype Sinatra (RPS) - Boiler Plate  

*A boiler plate which can be used to quickly spin-up Sinatra web-framework apps.*  
By default, this boilerplate comes loaded with the [Flat-UI CSS Theme](designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/â€Ž).

---

The baseline for this project comes from two projects, made with love by two amazing people:

- **[Playlister-RB](https://github.com/aviflombaum/playlister-rb/tree/sinatra-app)** by [Avi Flombaum](www.github.com/aviflombaum)  

- **[Ratpack](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/ratpack)** by [Ashley Williams](www.github.com/ashleygwilliams)

Let me know if you have any suggestions via comments / pull request!
